Object interner in Rust
=======================

== Documentation ==
To build the documentation, run `cargo doc`
Or browse it online at https://docs.rs/interns

== Dependencies ==
This crate works on nightly rust with zero dependencies.
But since it makes use of the raw_entry_mut experimental API,
we need to use hashbrown on stable rust.
By default the hashbrown feature is enabled.
